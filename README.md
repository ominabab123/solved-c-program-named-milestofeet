Write a C# program named MilesToFeet that declares a named constant that holds the number of feet in a mile: 5280. Also declare a variable to represent the distance in miles between your house and your uncle’ s house. Assign an appropriate value to the variable—for example: Compute and display the distance to your uncle’ s house in both miles and feet Display explanatory text with the values—for example: The distance to my uncle’s house is 8.5 miles or 44880 feet

Convert the MilesToFeet class to an interactive application named MilesToFeetInteractive Instead of assigning a value to the distance, accept the value from the user as input.
